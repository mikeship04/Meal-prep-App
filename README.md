Phase-2 project!

Joey Faris & Mike Shippy

This is an app for helping users meal prep!  Users will be able to search a recipe database and select recipes
based on matching criterea and use those recipes to help build a shopping list.  We will have navbar that will take in search criterea to pull in recipes to recipe cards with cooking instructions. user will be able to favorite a recipe
and on page load only favorite recipes will show by default.  User will be able to populate a shopping list and remove items from
the shopping list as they are purchased from the store.  User will be able to toggle to the shopping list via the shopping list form and handle deletes from there.
